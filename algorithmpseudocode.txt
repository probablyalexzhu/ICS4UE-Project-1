parse student object to find out what group 
make arraylists of each group using master list
put students in group

(OUTDATED!)
for each group:

    make array(list)s of each cohort
    for each cohort:

        create arraylist with number of tables necessary for cohort based on # of students

        for all tables in cohort (biggest to smallest) {
            pick random person 
                
            stick them and all their friends in a table

            while table is not full and if there are still friends to pick from (method) {
                pick random friend of random friend of first person

            }   

            once table full, next table
        }    
        

        for each table:
            if table is not full:
                find remaining capacity of table
                loop through tables after this table's index
                    if that table has less people than the remaining capacty of this table, move the people to this table
